# DA623: Demonstration of application PCA on Color Images

This repository is for DA623: Computing with Signals course project. It contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on color images for image compression. The tutorial covers two scenarios: compressing a grayscale image and compressing an RGB image.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique used in data analysis to simplify the complexity of high-dimensional data while retaining its essential information. This github repository focuses on applying PCA to images for compression, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing the dimensionality of image data while preserving important features.
